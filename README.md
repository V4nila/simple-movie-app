🎬 Simple Movie App

Hey there! 👋 This is one of my early React projects — a Simple Movie App where you can search movies and get their details using the OMDB API.

I built this app to practice React basics like fetching data, managing state, and rendering lists. It’s simple but a great learning step on my coding journey! 🚀
